Here's a Python script implementing the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encrypting and decrypting files using the PyCryptodome library. It reads a file, encrypts it, and saves the output, ensuring secure sharing.

Des File Encryption
How It Works:
Generates a random 8-byte DES key (save it for decryption).
Encrypts a given file (input.txt), pads data, and uses CBC mode with an IV.
Saves the IV + ciphertext in encrypted.des.
Decrypts encrypted.des back to decrypted.txt using the same key.
